Will Knowledge Transfer Meeting Agenda:
1. Physical meaning of EEG, and the relationships between ECG, EMG and EEG.
    i. Relative signal amplitude
    ii. Discussion about the electronics used to record EEG, ECG and the differences between them.
    iii. Basic demo of sleep spindles and the DREAMs database
    iv. Basic overview of filter design -- and how it relates to: visual analysis of EEG and machine learning feature extraction
    v. The most important properties of filters including: amplitude and phase characteristics on the decibel scale, s-plane zeros and poles
    vi. Explanation of how to recognize noise in an EEG or ECG waveform.
    vii. A very quick discussion about an automatic ECG classifier that I developed at SickKids

Part one resources:
    1. ECG instrumentation: INA333 Datasheet Page 15: http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina333.pdf (skim)
    2. EEG electrode positioning manual: https://www.trans-cranial.com/local/manuals/10_20_pos_man_v1_0_pdf.pdf (skim)
    3. The Art of Electronics: Chapters: Introduction && Active Filter Design (ignore the circuit design sections) (read)
    4. AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events 1st edn. http://www.nswo.nl/userfiles/files/AASM%20-%20Manual%20for%20the%20Scoring%20ofSleep%20and%20Associted%20Events%20-%2005-2007_2.pdf (skim, but consult as needed)

2. Interface Design - Expert interface for Neurologists and Novice Interface for Mechanical Turk
    i. The overall layout of the codebase and how I hope to reorganize it
    ii. The new data EEG database that I just finished building
    iii. My new very sleek EDF processing tool, and my plans to make a web version

    Expert interface specific:
        i. How I plan to adapt the interface to make it work better for neurologists based on my meeting with Andrew Lim
        ii. The design features that other EEG interfaces have that ours does not

    Novice interface specific:
    i. My goals for the novice interface, including tutorial and single channel testing
    ii. My design mockups

Part two resources:
    1. My emails chain with Andrew Lim
    2. My design sketches (they're mostly on paper now)
    3. The physionet ECG viewer (the interface is slightly dated, but they have much better waveform display than we do) LIGHTWAVE: http://physionet.org/lightwave/?db=challenge/2013/set-a
    4. Javascript files: annotator.js and eegdata.js under web/crowdspot/crowdspot/annotation/static/annotation/
    5. Python files: views.py

3. Ethics application and my future work
    i. The tutorial I'm designing
    ii. The sleep spindle indentification experiment on mechanical turk
    iii. Our plans to have experts annotate EEG and give us their thoughs on how to deal with ambiguous cases
    iv. What the ORE has, and what it is currently missing

Part three resources:
    1. Nature methods: sleep spindle detection: http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n4/full/nmeth.2855.html
    2. Conducting behavioural research on mechanical turk: http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2Fs13428-011-0124-6

4. Scheduling
    i. Mechanical turk experiment - approx one month form now
    ii. Ethics -- end of this week
    iii. EDF online tool, improvements to expert interface -- Perhaps Will can pick one and take it on this month?
